const sampleText = `Hi Treasure, ðŸ‘‹ [playful] Did you know that before the Von Neumann Architecture, computers were really tricky to change? Back then, engineers had to physically rewire the hardware just to make a computer do something different â€” [sarcastically] imagine having to rebuild your phone every time you wanted to open a new app! [giggles]

Then came the stored program concept. ðŸ“š [excited] This idea changed everything! It meant that both the instructions â€” the program â€” and the data could live together in the same memory. So instead of rewiring the machine, [relieved] you could simply load a new program whenever you wanted!

This turned computers into flexible, powerful tools that could do millions of different things â€” just by swapping programs in and out of memory. [in awe] It's the reason you can browse the web, play games, or write an essay all on the same device today!

[whispers] So, the next time you open an app or update your operating system, remember â€” that's the stored program concept in action. [playful] Pretty amazing, right? ðŸ’¡ [giggles]`;
